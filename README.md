Introducing scala features via conversion from java and some one-liners


The java in ResultAnnouncerJav.java becomes bad scala in ResultAnnouncerBadScala.scala , before becoming more idiomatic ResultAnnouncer.scala

One liners from https://mkaz.github.io/2011/05/31/10-scala-one-liners-to-impress-your-friends/ are in one-liners.sc scratch file.
