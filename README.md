# Scala Intro
Introducing scala features via conversion from java and some one-liners


The java in ResultAnnouncerJav.java becomes bad scala in ResultAnnouncerBadScala.scala , before becoming more idiomatic ResultAnnouncer.scala

One liners from https://mkaz.github.io/2011/05/31/10-scala-one-liners-to-impress-your-friends/ are in one-liners.sc scratch file.

Intellij Scala setup: see instructions here https://bitbucket.org/ngli_test/scala-dojo/wiki/Home , but for the git url use instead the one for this project https://github.com/nico78/introScala.git
